  <h2>The story of the second Escape WAD</h2>
  <br>
  <h3>MAP 1: UNDERGROUND</h3>
  <p>In the nick of time you have made your way into the bunker prepared for the demon invasion of earth. But the bunker has been overrun. 
    Your next course of action escape the bunker as it is one way and your weapons have been destroyed by the bunker system. You must escape to the exit.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>MAP2: SUNRISE</h3>
    <p>You smell the ashes in the air when you make it to the surface. There is no sign of other humans, but on a radio left on when the demons came, a speech of a
      German legion of soldiers who have decided to try to make a revolution but now they are hiding from the demons. There is a clear sign of them being neo Nazis but you should still try to look for them. Maybe they can help you. 
      The Nazis are trying to get to a bunker on the other side of your village. Where it is confirmed that humans are surviving. You can get there through the industrial zone. </p>
  <br>
  <h3>MAP3: INDUSTRIAL ZONE</h3>
<p>There are many demons where you are but you must fight your way to the safe bunker. You are almost to the surface. Just keep pushing. The neo Nazis are still hiding out.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>MAP4: DAMNATION</h3>
  <p>Earth is destroyed. Houses are leveled and demons are everywhere. There are plenty of supplies 
    from the efforts of dead space marines. The safe bunker seems to still be emitting radio singles of humans calling out to anyone. And with enough fighting you will be able to be safe. With it being rumored that there is enough food to last for decades.
