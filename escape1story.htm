  <h2>The story of the first Escape.WAD</h2>
  <p>You wake up in your farm, hearing terrible things outside. Yesterday you decided not to evacuate the area to the bunker at the end of the village.
    The space marnies had told you that if you want to live you would have to evacuate, but you said no. so now you are stuck in a demon invaded earth with your shotgun and a pack of cigars. You have to get to that bunker.</p>
